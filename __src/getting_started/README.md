# Getting Started

This tutorial will guide you through the setup of a _Fetchq_ project.

**NOTE:** You are going to use _Docker_, _Postgres_ and _NodeJS_ to set this up.
I assume you have at least a brief working with those tools.

* [01 - Setup Postgres database](./01-postgres-setup.md)
* 02 - Basic SQL queries
* 03 - Setup a NodeJS client
