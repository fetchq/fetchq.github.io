# Getting Started

This tutorial will guide you through the setup of a _Fetchq_ project.

**NOTE:** You are going to use _Docker_, _Postgres_ and _NodeJS_ to set this up.
I assume you have at least a brief working with those tools.

### Follow those steps:

1. [Setup Postgres](01-setup-postgres.md)
2. [Initialize Fetchq](02-initialize-fetchq.md)
3. [Create a new queue](03-create-queue.md)
4. [Push a document](04-push-document.md)
5. [Consume a queue](05-consume-queue.md)
6. [Run the maintenance](06-maintenance.md)
7. [Explore the metrics](07-metrics.md)
8. [Use with NodeJS](08-node-client.md)
