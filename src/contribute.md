# How to contrbute

## Setup your local development machine

In order to run the development stuff you need to clone a couple of repos and install
some node dependencies. 

The process might change in time and we thought it may be easier to collect all the
steps in a [publig gist](https://gist.github.com/marcopeg/cc0fab6c1be1fafb7fd7c4fd87f08ff9).

You can run the script as a single command line instruction:

```
# OSX
bash <(curl -fsSL https://gist.github.com/marcopeg/cc0fab6c1be1fafb7fd7c4fd87f08ff9/raw)

# Linux
wget -O - https://gist.github.com/marcopeg/cc0fab6c1be1fafb7fd7c4fd87f08ff9/raw | bash -s
```

We recommend you run this from an empty folder that you reserve to Fetchq:

```
mkdir fetchq \
&& cd fetchq \
&& bash <(curl -fsSL https://gist.github.com/marcopeg/cc0fab6c1be1fafb7fd7c4fd87f08ff9/raw)
```
